## Project Summary

This submission successfully implements all requirements for the Railse Backend Engineer Challenge:

### ✅ Part 0: Project Setup & Structuring
- **Professional Spring Boot project structure** with Maven build system
- **Clean package organization**: controllers, services, models, DTOs, mappers, repositories
- **Required dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.2.4, MapStruct 1.5.5.Final, Lombok
- **Runs successfully** on port 8080 with comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Part 1: Bug Fixes
- **Bug #1 - Task Re-assignment**: Fixed duplicate task creation; now properly cancels old tasks when reassigning
- **Bug #2 - Cancelled Tasks**: Modified fetch endpoints to filter out CANCELLED tasks from user views

### ✅ Part 2: New Features
- **Feature #1 - Smart Daily Task View**: Enhanced date-based filtering to include all actionable tasks
- **Feature #2 - Task Priority**: Complete HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority system with update and filter endpoints
- **Feature #3 - Comments & Activity History**: Full task tracking with user comments and automated activity logging

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Architecture & Code Quality
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns across layers
- **Professional Structure**: Industry-standard package organization
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive use of enums and strongly-typed DTOs
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Thread Safety**: ConcurrentHashMap for safe in-memory storage

### API Design
- **RESTful Conventions**: Proper HTTP methods and status codes
- **Comprehensive Endpoints**: All required functionality plus enhancements
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and error responses
- **Response Consistency**: Standardized response format across all endpoints

### Key API Endpoints Implemented
- `GET /task-mgmt/{id}` - Task details with comments & history
- `POST /task-mgmt/create` - Create tasks with priority
- `POST /task-mgmt/assign-by-ref` - Fixed reassignment logic
- `POST /task-mgmt/fetch-by-date/v2` - Smart task filtering
- `POST /task-mgmt/update-priority` - Priority management
- `GET /task-mgmt/priority/{priority}` - Filter by priority
- `POST /task-mgmt/{taskId}/comments` - Add task comments

## Testing & Validation

All endpoints have been thoroughly tested and demonstrated to work correctly:
- ✅ Application starts successfully without errors
- ✅ All CRUD operations function properly
- ✅ Bug fixes resolve the reported issues
- ✅ New features meet the specified requirements
- ✅ API responses include proper data structures
- ✅ Error handling works as expected
